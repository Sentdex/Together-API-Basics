    "There are quite a few inference APIs popping up now and, for any given model, you might find one API is cheaper than another and, as time goes on, the cheapest provider for some model might also change.\n",
    "\n",
    "For me personally, I've been following the team at Together for a while now and I really like what they are doing. They are also quite fast at adding new models and have a very large selection of text generation, chat, image and code specific models.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also not just about who is the cheapest. It's who is the fastest and most reliable. At least from my testing so far, I have found the Together API to be extremely fast and consistent. Lately, I would say it's faster and more reliable than OpenAI's API. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, why API at all? One of main reasons I ever even used the OpenAI API was it's just easy to quickly try out ideas. All of the models on the Together API are open source models that you could download and run yourself, but the Together API is just easier. It's convenient and likely faster than any API you're probably going to build for yourself, but still, at any point, anything you build on the Together API could be moved to your own hardware and kept private internally, which is just nice to know. \n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, so let's check it out. To use the API, you'll need to set up an account and billing. I believe they also give some credit at sign up, but depending on when you see this that might be different. Once set up, you'll need to grab a key, which you can find in your settings by clicking your account logo at the top right, going to settings, and then API keys will be there.\n",

    "You can feel free to just place your key as plain text, but I'll use a .env file so I don't share my key with the world. \n",

I've found it to be quite fast and accurate. The more popular 34B code model tends to be `WizardLM/WizardCoder-Python-34B-V1.0`, which is also available via the API. Both of these models also have V2s now too, hint hint together, but this was also just plain my first test with Phind. \n",

You need to create some sort of rudimentary local API...etc. For me personally, I know I am not the best, and I haven't made this process perfectly fast, but to test and try any new model, it tends to take about an hour per model. It's too much time such that I'm not willing to test many models out. But on Together, or some other decent API, you can just instantly test some model. Each of these 34B models, for example, are 60 to 70+GB in size, and fairly slow to run locally. I can test new models on Together in seconds, and that's just awesome. I can build my entire application on that API, or just use it to test and then run locally, or keep using the API since it's extremely cheap and fast to run, but also know that I can leave at any time and run totally local with these open source models.\n",

    "### User Message\n",
    "[USER MESSAGE]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assistant\n",
    "```\n",

    "Note: I did the above format thinking, for some reason, that was the proper format for the Phind model. I later found out that the proper format is actually:\n",

    "```\n",
    "Model instructions:\\n\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But the former also just happened to work out fine despite my mistake!\n",

    "\n",
    "Finally, we also give 1 final nudge to the model that we want bash commands by beginning the opening of some code formatting for bash.\n",
    "\n",
    "So then we can just ask the user what they actually want, and then the model should be responding with a series of bash commands. We can then use a regular expression to pull a list of bash commands, then we can use `os.system` to execute those commands. "
